# Forecasting Stock Prices
**Data Analytics and Big Data Capstone Project 2018c-5 - Data Science with Python**

This project is a demonstration to assess the applicability of Machine Learning algorithms in the prediction of 'Stock Price' in technology-based companies.
We will use as evaluation metrics the same ones suggested in [kaggle.com] (www.kaggle.com), such as: accuracy, standard deviation and RMSE

* Dataset: [MacroTrends] (https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/stock-price-history)
